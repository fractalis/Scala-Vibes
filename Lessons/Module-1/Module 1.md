### üîç Research Topics (10)

1. **What is Scala and why use it?** ‚Äì Study the high‚Äëlevel features of the language: high‚Äëlevel syntax, expressive type system, fusion of object‚Äëoriented and functional paradigms, and its ability to run on the JVM and in the browser[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/scala-features.html#:~:text=Looking%20at%20Scala%20from%20the,the%20following%20statements%20about%20it).
2. **Scala vs Java ‚Äì key differences** ‚Äì Explore how Scala simplifies boilerplate code, removes semicolons, and seamlessly interoperates with Java code[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/scala-for-java-programmers.html#:~:text=At%20a%20Glance%3A%20Why%20Scala%3F).

### üß† Definitions, Concepts & Application

- **Definition of Scala:** A statically typed, high‚Äëlevel programming language that fuses object‚Äëoriented and functional programming and runs on the JVM and in the browser[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/scala-features.html#:~:text=Looking%20at%20Scala%20from%20the,the%20following%20statements%20about%20it).
- **Class:** Blueprint for creating objects; contains members like methods and variables. The primary constructor is part of the class signature[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/classes.html#:~:text=Classes%20in%20Scala%20are%20blueprints,covered%20later%20in%20the%20tour).
- **Trait:** A mechanism for sharing interfaces and fields. Traits can be extended by classes and objects but cannot be instantiated[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/traits.html#:~:text=Traits%20are%20used%20to%20share,and%20therefore%20have%20no%20parameters).
- **Case class:** Special class that exports its constructor parameters, provides structural equality, and supports pattern matching[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/pattern-matching.html#:~:text=Matching%20on%20case%20classes).
- **Immutable vs¬†mutable collections:** Immutable collections never change, while mutable collections can be updated in place[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections-2.13/overview.html#:~:text=Scala%20collections%20systematically%20distinguish%20between,leave%20the%20old%20collection%20unchanged).
- **Pattern matching:** Mechanism for checking a value against patterns and deconstructing it[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/pattern-matching.html#:~:text=Pattern%20matching%20is%20a%20mechanism,a%20series%20of%20if%2Felse%20statements).

**Concepts & Applications:**

- **Fusion of OOP and FP:** Scala allows you to use classes, objects, and inheritance alongside higher‚Äëorder functions and immutability.
- **Type safety and inference:** Static types catch errors at compile time while type inference reduces verbosity.
- **Immutability:** Encourages safer concurrent programming by avoiding side effects; use immutable collections by default.[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections-2.13/overview.html#:~:text=Scala%20collections%20systematically%20distinguish%20between,leave%20the%20old%20collection%20unchanged).
- **Trait composition:** Enables flexible code reuse similar to multiple inheritance; mix in multiple traits to extend functionality of a class.
- **Pattern matching on case classes:** Simplifies deconstructing complex data types and is widely used in functional data modeling[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/pattern-matching.html#:~:text=Matching%20on%20case%20classes).

**Applications:** Use these concepts to build reliable and maintainable code. For example, model domain entities as case classes, use traits for service interfaces, and pattern matching to handle different cases of a sealed trait.
