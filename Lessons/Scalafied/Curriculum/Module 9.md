### üîç Libraries & Frameworks to Explore

- **Play Framework:** High‚Äëproductivity web framework with hot reloading[playframework.com](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/3.0.x/Introduction#:~:text=%C2%A7What%20is%20Play%3F).
- **http4s:** Functional, type‚Äësafe HTTP toolkit built on Cats Effect.
- **Akka HTTP/Pekko HTTP:** Low‚Äëlevel, high‚Äëperformance HTTP server built on Akka.
- **Sangria:** GraphQL server library for Scala.
- **Circe & Play JSON:** Libraries for JSON encoding/decoding.
- **Slick:** Functional relational mapping for databases.
- **Cats Effect & ZIO:** Libraries providing effect systems used by http4s and Pekko.
- **Kamon & Prometheus:** Observability libraries for metrics and tracing.
- **MacWire/Guice:** Dependency injection libraries.
- **Docker & Kubernetes:** Tools for containerisation and orchestration of services.

### üìñ Definitions

- **Model‚ÄëView‚ÄëController (MVC):** Architectural pattern separating the data (Model), the user interface (View), and the control logic (Controller); used in Play to organise web apps.
- **Reactive Streams:** Specification for asynchronous stream processing with non‚Äëblocking back‚Äëpressure; implemented by Akka Streams and http4s.
- **Directive:** In Akka HTTP, a building block for composing routes; encapsulates extraction of request data and computation of responses.
- **Route:** A function from `HttpRequest` to `RouteResult` defined using directives; describes how a service responds to requests.
- **GraphQL:** A query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need and nothing more.
- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Technique where components receive their dependencies from external sources rather than creating them directly. Guice and MacWire provide DI frameworks.
- **Property‚ÄëBased Testing:** Testing paradigm where properties of the output are asserted for many randomly generated inputs. ScalaCheck is a key library.
- **Observability:** The ability to understand a system‚Äôs state through logs, metrics, and traces; critical for production systems.

### üí° Concepts

- **Reactive Web:** Play‚Äôs reactive, stateless design utilises a built‚Äëin HTTP server and Pekko Streams for predictability and scalability[playframework.com](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/3.0.x/Introduction#:~:text=%C2%A7What%20is%20Play%3F).
- **Type‚ÄëSafe Routing:** http4s and Akka HTTP routes are first‚Äëclass Scala values that the compiler can verify, reducing runtime errors.
- **Back‚ÄëPressure in HTTP:** Streaming endpoints must handle producers and consumers at different rates; Pekko/Akka Streams implement back‚Äëpressure at the protocol level.
- **GraphQL vs REST:** GraphQL allows clients to specify queries on a schema; REST exposes resources via endpoints. GraphQL reduces over‚Äëfetching but increases complexity.
- **Functional Effects:** Libraries like cats‚Äëeffect and ZIO model side effects as values, enabling safer concurrency and composition in web services.
- **DI Patterns:** Preference for constructor injection or functional patterns (Reader monad) avoids reliance on reflection-based frameworks and improves testability.

### üß™ Applications

- **Build a REST API:** Use Play or http4s to create a versioned API, handle JSON requests/responses, and validate input.
- **Streaming Endpoints:** Implement websockets or server‚Äësent events using Akka HTTP or Pekko HTTP; manage concurrency with Actors.
- **GraphQL Gateway:** Use Sangria to provide a unified schema for multiple microservices; use federation or schema stitching to merge services.
- **Service Discovery:** Integrate a service like Consul or Eureka to locate services at runtime; configure clients accordingly.
- **Containerised Deployment:** Create a Dockerfile for your web service, run it locally, and deploy to a Kubernetes cluster with health checks.

### üìå Additional Tips & Resources

1. **üî• Use Hot Reloading:** Play‚Äôs hot reloading speeds up development; ensure you understand how the dev mode differs from production.
2. **üíæ Manage Blocking Calls:** Offload blocking I/O (e.g., database queries) onto dedicated thread pools when using http4s or Akka HTTP.
3. **üõ°Ô∏è Secure Your API:** Use HTTPS, CSRF protection (Play provides built‚Äëin support[playframework.com](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/3.0.x/Introduction#:~:text=%C2%A7What%20is%20Play%3F)), and rate‚Äëlimiting.
4. **üîç Use Middleware:** In http4s, middlewares (e.g., for logging, authentication) compose elegantly; explore building your own.
5. **‚ö†Ô∏è Handle Timeouts:** Set appropriate timeouts for HTTP clients and servers to avoid resource exhaustion.
6. **üêõ Debug with Logging:** Use structured logging (e.g., Logback with Logstash encoder) to capture contextual data.
7. **üìö Explore Templating:** Play has Twirl for server-side templates; http4s often uses static front‚Äëends. Evaluate when server-side rendering is appropriate.
8. **üß∞ Simplify DI:** MacWire‚Äôs compile‚Äëtime DI avoids runtime reflection and errors; consider it for type‚Äësafe wiring.
9. **üìú Document your API:** Use tools like OpenAPI or GraphiQL UI to document and explore your endpoints.
10. **üß™ Test Thoroughly:** Combine unit tests, property-based tests, and integration tests to ensure reliability.
