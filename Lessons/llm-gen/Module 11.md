## Module¬†11 ‚Äì Cross‚ÄëPlatform Scala: Scala.js & Scala Native (Weeks¬†21‚Äì22)

**Why this matters:** Scala isn‚Äôt just for the JVM; it targets JavaScript and native binaries too! Cross‚Äëplatform development lets you reuse your Scala skills across frontend web, mobile, embedded, and command‚Äëline applications.

### üìö Ten Research Topics

1. **Scala.js Basics:** Understand how Scala code is compiled to JavaScript and can run in the browser or Node.js. Scala.js allows Scala programs to run in the same environments as JavaScript[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/scala-for-javascript-devs.html#:~:text=,other%20JavaScript%20and%20Scala%20libraries).
2. **Building UIs:** Explore frontend libraries such as Laminar, scalajs‚Äëreact, Slinky, and Vue.js bindings. Compare them with React in JavaScript.
3. **Facades & Interop:** Learn how to write facade types and use `@JSImport`, `@JSGlobal`, and `@JSExportTopLevel` to interact with JavaScript libraries.
4. **Cross‚ÄëBuilding:** Research how to configure SBT for cross‚Äëbuilding shared code across JVM, JS, and Native targets using `crossProject` and `ScalaModule`.
5. **Scala Native Overview:** Study features of Scala Native: low‚Äëlevel primitives, interop with C, and instant startup time[scala-native.org](https://www.scala-native.org/en/stable/#:~:text=Scala%20Native%20is%20an%20optimizing,It%20features).
6. **FFI (Foreign Function Interface):** Learn how to call C code from Scala Native using `extern` objects and pointer types[scala-native.org](https://www.scala-native.org/en/stable/#:~:text=,code).
7. **Memory Management:** Investigate how Scala Native manages memory via stack allocation (`stackalloc`) and interacts with the garbage collector.
8. **Node.js & Tooling:** Examine JavaScript environments (Node.js, JSDOM, Playwright, Selenium) available for running tests and applications in Scala.js[scala-js.org](https://www.scala-js.org/doc/project/js-environments.html#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20decide%20how,you%20need%20to%20install%20separately).
9. **Bundling & Packaging:** Research how to bundle Scala.js applications with Webpack or Vite, manage dependencies, and produce optimized output.
10. **WebAssembly & WASM:** Explore the experimental Scala.js support for emitting WebAssembly and how it may integrate with Scala Native.

### üìñ Definitions

- **Scala.js:** A Scala compiler target that generates JavaScript; allows Scala code to run in the browser or other JS environments[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/scala-for-javascript-devs.html#:~:text=,other%20JavaScript%20and%20Scala%20libraries).
- **Scala Native:** An ahead‚Äëof‚Äëtime compiler for Scala that targets native binaries via LLVM; features low‚Äëlevel primitives and fast startup[scala-native.org](https://www.scala-native.org/en/stable/#:~:text=Scala%20Native%20is%20an%20optimizing,It%20features).
- **Facade:** A Scala.js trait or object that declares types and signatures for JavaScript APIs, enabling static typing when calling JS functions.
- **crossProject:** SBT configuration that builds a project for multiple targets (JVM, JS, Native) from a shared codebase.
- **JS Environment:** Execution environment for Scala.js code; could be Node.js, JSDOM, Playwright, PhantomJS, or a real browser[scala-js.org](https://www.scala-js.org/doc/project/js-environments.html#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20decide%20how,you%20need%20to%20install%20separately).
- **FFI:** Foreign Function Interface; mechanism that allows a program to call functions written in another language (e.g., Scala Native calling C functions[scala-native.org](https://www.scala-native.org/en/stable/#:~:text=,code)).
- **Bundler:** Tool (Webpack, Vite) that bundles JavaScript (including compiled Scala.js output) into packages for the browser.
- **WebAssembly (WASM):** Binary instruction format for a stack‚Äëbased virtual machine; provides near‚Äënative performance in web environments.

### üí° Concepts

- **Single Codebase:** Write logic once and reuse it across server, client, and native applications via cross‚Äëprojects.
- **Static Typing for JS:** Facades provide compile‚Äëtime safety when interacting with untyped JavaScript APIs.
- **Low‚ÄëLevel Control:** Scala Native offers direct pointers and stack allocation, giving developers fine‚Äëgrained control over memory[scala-native.org](https://www.scala-native.org/en/stable/#:~:text=val%20vec%20%3D%20stackalloc,%2F%2F%20pass%20by%20reference).
- **Interop:** Both Scala.js and Scala Native emphasize seamless interop (with JavaScript and C respectively)[scala-native.org](https://www.scala-native.org/en/stable/#:~:text=,code)[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/scala-for-javascript-devs.html#:~:text=,other%20JavaScript%20and%20Scala%20libraries).
- **Optimised Output:** Ahead‚Äëof‚Äëtime compilation for native code removes warm‚Äëup time; Scala.js linking removes unused code for smaller bundles.
- **Tools & Environments:** Understanding available JS environments (Node, JSDOM, Playwright) helps choose the right testing and execution environment[scala-js.org](https://www.scala-js.org/doc/project/js-environments.html#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20decide%20how,you%20need%20to%20install%20separately).

### üß™ Applications

- **Front‚ÄëEnd Development:** Use Scala.js to build interactive web UIs, leveraging static typing and functional patterns.
- **Shared Domain Models:** Define case classes and business logic once and reuse them across the backend and frontend via cross‚Äëbuilds.
- **Systems Programming:** Write native CLI tools with Scala Native, benefiting from rapid startup and low memory overhead.
- **Interop with Libraries:** Use facades to call JavaScript libraries (e.g., D3.js) or C libraries (e.g., libcurl) with type safety.
- **Hybrid Apps:** Combine Scala.js for the UI, Scala JVM for business logic, and Scala Native for performance‚Äëcritical modules.
