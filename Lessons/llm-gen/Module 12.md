## 🔬 Module 12 – Advanced Functional Programming & Type‑Level Design (Weeks 23–24)

**Why this matters:** Functional programming principles and type‑level techniques allow you to create robust, generic, and declarative code. Scala’s rich type system empowers you to model domain constraints and derive code automatically.

### 📚 Ten Research Topics

1. **Functors, Applicatives, and Monads:** Study these foundational abstractions; understand how they enable mapping, sequencing, and context combination.
2. **Semigroups & Monoids:** Explore algebraic structures used to combine values; learn about their laws and common instances.
3. **Monad Transformers & MTL:** Investigate how to stack effects (e.g., `OptionT`, `EitherT`) and the tagless final (MTL) style for composing effects.
4. **Type Classes:** Learn how to define and use type classes for ad‑hoc polymorphism; explore Scala 3’s `given`/`using` syntax.
5. **Free & Cofree Monads:** Understand free monads for building interpreters and DSLs; contrast with tagless final approaches.
6. **GADTs & Indexed Types:** Research Generalised Algebraic Data Types and how they model operations with additional compile‑time information.
7. **Type‑Level Programming:** Dive into shapeless (or its Scala 3 successor such as `scala-derive`), union & intersection types, and dependent types.
8. **Macros & Meta‑Programming:** Explore Scala 3 inline methods, macros, and compile‑time operations. Understand how to generate code or perform checks at compile time.
9. **Effect Systems:** Delve deeper into Cats Effect, ZIO, and Monix Task. Compare how they handle concurrency, error handling, and resource management.
10. **Domain‑Specific Languages (DSLs):** Study how to build DSLs in Scala using higher‑order functions, implicit parameters, and type classes. Look at examples like Doobie, Cats Parsers, and Caliban.

### 📖 Definitions

- **Functor:** Abstraction that allows mapping a function over a context (`map`).
- **Applicative:** Extends Functor; allows applying functions wrapped in a context to values in a context.
- **Monad:** Abstraction enabling sequencing of computations that produce a context (`flatMap`). Must satisfy associativity and identity laws.
- **Semigroup & Monoid:** Algebraic structures with an associative combine operation; a monoid also has an identity element.
- **Type Class:** A way to define behaviour for a set of types without modifying the types themselves; implemented with implicit/given instances.
- **Monad Transformer:** Wrapper that stacks monads to combine effects (e.g., `OptionT[F]` wraps an `F[Option]`).
- **Free Monad:** A construction that builds monads from any functor; used to describe sequences of instructions to be interpreted later.
- **GADT:** Generalised Algebraic Data Type; allows specifying more precise types for constructors, encoding invariants at the type level.
- **Tagless Final:** Style of building programs with type class constraints instead of concrete effect stacks; enables interpreting programs into different effect types.
- **Macro / Inline:** Compile‑time code generation or manipulation using Scala 3’s `inline` and `quotes` features.

### 💡 Concepts

- **Lawful Type Classes:** When defining a type class, ensure it obeys laws (e.g., monad laws) so that generic code behaves predictably.
- **Composability:** Functional abstractions like monads and applicatives enable modular, composable program design.
- **Effect Polymorphism:** Using type classes (e.g., `F[_]: Monad`) allows writing code that works for any effect type (IO, Task, ZIO).
- **Abstraction Without Performance Loss:** Scala 3’s inline and macro features allow removing abstraction overhead at compile time.
- **Type Safety:** GADTs and refined types encode invariants into the type system, preventing illegal states.
- **Designing DSLs:** DSLs provide expressive ways to model domain logic; free monads and tagless final patterns offer different trade‑offs in extensibility and performance.

### 🧪 Applications

- **Reusable Libraries:** Implement generic libraries (e.g., logging, validation) that operate on any effect type thanks to type classes.
- **Error Accumulation:** Use applicative validation to accumulate multiple errors instead of failing fast.
- **Interpreters:** Build interpreters that run DSL programs in different environments—pure, effectful, or streaming.
- **State Machines:** Model state machines with GADTs to ensure only valid transitions are representable.
- **Compile‑Time Safety:** Use macros and refined types to enforce constraints (e.g., SQL query correctness) at compile time.

### 📌 Additional Tips & Resources

1. **🧠 Reason About Laws:** Test your type class implementations with property‑based testing to verify laws.
2. **⚖️ Choose the Right Abstraction:** Not everything needs a monad; sometimes applicatives or plain functions suffice.
3. **🔧 Use Newtype Libraries:** Libraries like `newtype` or `deriving` allow adding type distinctions without runtime overhead.
4. **🧵 Avoid Monad Transformer Soup:** Deep stacks can become hard to work with; consider tagless final or effect systems like ZIO that encapsulate multiple effects.
