### üìñ Definitions

- **Unit Test:** A small piece of code that verifies the behaviour of a specific unit (e.g., a method) in isolation.
- **Property‚ÄëBased Test:** A test that states a property which should hold for a range of inputs; test runners generate random inputs to check the property[scalatest.org](https://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/property_based_testing#:~:text=Property).
- **Mock / Stub:** Fake implementations of components used to isolate units under test by simulating dependencies.
- **Coverage:** A metric indicating the proportion of code executed by tests; tools like Scoverage compute it.
- **Static Analysis:** Analysis of code without executing it; tools like Scalafix and SonarQube identify issues and enforce style.
- **Microbenchmark:** A small program that measures the performance of specific operations using JMH to reduce noise.
- **Fixture:** Setup and teardown logic shared across multiple tests to provide consistent test environments.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Practice of automatically building and testing code on every commit to detect issues early.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automating the release of software after successful testing and verification.
- **Profiler:** A tool that measures resource usage (CPU, memory) to identify performance bottlenecks.

### üí° Concepts

- **Test Pyramid:** Structure emphasising many unit tests, fewer integration tests, and even fewer end‚Äëto‚Äëend tests.
- **Determinism:** Tests should be deterministic; property‚Äëbased tests with generators may require constraints to avoid non‚Äëdeterministic failures.
- **Isolation:** Unit tests should isolate the unit being tested; mocking and stubbing help achieve this.
- **Fail Fast vs Error Collection:** Some tests should fail on the first error; property‚Äëbased tests may collect errors across many inputs.
- **Automation:** Running tests, formatting, and static analysis automatically ensures consistent quality and reduces manual effort.
- **Measuring & Profiling:** Benchmarking and profiling identify performance issues; avoid optimizing prematurely and focus on hotspots.
- **Evolutionary Code:** Tools like Scalafix help refactor code safely as APIs evolve.

### üß™ Applications

- **TDD Practice:** Use test-driven development to design APIs and ensure they meet specifications.
- **Property Validation:** Use property‚Äëbased tests to validate invariants, such as ordering or idempotency of operations.
- **Mocking External Services:** Simulate external services (databases, APIs) in unit tests to avoid network calls.
- **Performance Analysis:** Benchmark critical functions and profile to identify performance bottlenecks.
- **CI/CD Setup:** Automate build, test, formatting, static analysis, and deployment to maintain quality and accelerate delivery.

### üìå Additional Tips & Resources

1. **üîÅ Run Tests Frequently:** Integrate tests into your editor or IDE to get immediate feedback.
2. **üßº Maintain Test Readability:** Use descriptive names and clear structure; tests are documentation.
3. **üß† Limit Mocking:** Overusing mocks can hide integration issues; consider real implementations with in‚Äëmemory databases or stub servers.
4. **üßÆ Use Generators Wisely:** Customise generators in ScalaCheck to generate valid and meaningful test data.
5. **üîã Keep Benchmarks Isolated:** JMH requires proper annotations and warm‚Äëup iterations to produce reliable measurements.
6. **üõ†Ô∏è Combine Tools:** Use Scalafmt for formatting and Scalafix for transformations; run them in CI to enforce consistency.
7. **üì¢ Add Test Tags:** Use tagging in ScalaTest to categorize slow tests or integration tests and run subsets locally.
8. **üß∞ Use Testcontainers:** For integration tests, use Testcontainers to spin up databases or message brokers on demand.
9. **üìà Visualise Coverage:** Generate HTML coverage reports with Scoverage; integrate them into your quality dashboard.
10. **‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid Flaky Tests:** Ensure that tests are independent of timing, environment, or ordering to prevent flakes.
