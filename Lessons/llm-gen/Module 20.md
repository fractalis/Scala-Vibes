## üñ•Ô∏è Module¬†20¬†‚Äì Terminal UIs & System Scripting (Weeks¬†39‚Äì40)

**Why this matters:** Not every application needs a graphical interface. Terminal user interfaces (TUIs) are lightweight, accessible and ideal for dashboards, monitoring tools and interactive CLI applications. Scala‚Äôs scripting capabilities (Ammonite, Scala CLI) enable you to automate tasks and prototype ideas quickly without heavy build setups.

### üìö Ten Research Topics

1. **TUI frameworks:** Explore TUI libraries such as Terminus (part of Creative Scala), Lanterna (Java library akin to curses), tui‚Äëscala and JLine. Understand their capabilities for rendering text, colours, widgets and handling input.
2. **Creative Scala ‚Äì Terminus:** Study how the Creative Scala project provides Terminus, a library for building terminal applications across JVM, JavaScript and Scala Native[creativescala.org](https://www.creativescala.org/#:~:text=,adds%20interactive%20visualizations%20to%20Doodle).
3. **Ammonite scripting:** Investigate Ammonite‚Äôs REPL and scripting capabilities; learn how it improves on the default Scala REPL with syntax highlighting, multi‚Äëline editing and loading dependencies[ammonite.io](https://ammonite.io/#:~:text=Ammonite%20lets%20you%20use%20the,the%20REPL%20or%20as%20scripts).
4. **Scala CLI:** Research Scala CLI as a modern tool for compiling, running and packaging Scala code. Compare it to sbt for scripting and small projects.
5. **Command‚Äëline parsing:** Compare libraries like scopt, decline, case‚Äëapp and picocli. Understand how to define commands, options and subcommands.
6. **Automation & task runners:** Study how to automate system tasks (file manipulation, backups, HTTP requests) using Scala scripts and libraries like requests‚Äëscala.
7. **Interactive dashboards:** Learn how to build interactive dashboards in the terminal that display real‚Äëtime data (e.g., system metrics, logs, stock prices).
8. **Text‚Äëbased games:** Explore designing interactive fiction and roguelike games using TUI libraries; learn about event loops and map rendering.
9. **Packaging CLI tools:** Research how to package scripts as native executables using GraalVM or Scala Native, and how to publish them as brew/apt packages.
10. **Remote scripting:** Look into using SSH libraries from Scala to run commands on remote servers; study secure credential handling and concurrency.

### üõ† Applications (How to apply the principles)

- **Start with scripts:** Use Ammonite or Scala CLI to automate personal tasks (file renaming, data conversion) without creating an sbt project[ammonite.io](https://ammonite.io/#:~:text=Scala%20Scripts).
- **Design TUIs with components:** Break dashboards into panels; use Terminus or Lanterna widgets to render tables, forms and charts.

- **Automate remote tasks:** Write scripts that use SSH libraries to manage servers, deploy code and monitor logs.
- **Monitor & visualise:** Build dashboards that poll APIs or system metrics and update the terminal view in real time.
- **Package as native:** Compile your scripts to native binaries using GraalVM or Scala Native for easier distribution.
- **Version control your scripts:** Keep scripts in a repository; use CI to run tests and ensure quality.
- **Iterate in the REPL:** Use Ammonite‚Äôs REPL for exploratory coding, loading dependencies on the fly and saving results[ammonite.io](https://ammonite.io/#:~:text=Ammonite%20lets%20you%20use%20the,the%20REPL%20or%20as%20scripts).
- **Integrate with CI/CD:** Use CLI tools in your CI pipeline to automate tests, packaging and deployments.
- **Ensure cross‚Äëcompatibility:** Test your scripts on multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) and adjust for differences in file paths and shell behaviour.
