## üïπÔ∏è Module¬†22¬†‚Äì Advanced Game Development & Tools (Weeks¬†43‚Äì44)

**Why this matters:** Building a polished game requires more than a basic loop. Advanced AI, networking, procedural content, tooling and performance tuning separate simple prototypes from professional‚Äëquality games. Exploring these areas deepens your understanding of algorithms, concurrency and user experience.

### üìö Ten Research Topics

1. **Game AI:** Study algorithms for pathfinding (A* search, Dijkstra), finite state machines, behaviour trees and decision trees; explore how these drive NPC behaviour.
2. **Procedural Generation:** Investigate noise functions (Perlin, simplex), fractal terrain, dungeon generation and randomised item placement. Learn how to create content on the fly.
3. **Networking & Multiplayer:** Research client‚Äìserver architecture, synchronisation strategies (lockstep, authoritative server), lag compensation, prediction and interpolation. Examine libraries like KryoNet and Netty for network messaging.
4. **UI & UX Design:** Explore game UI frameworks (Scene2D UI in libGDX, JavaFX), menu systems, input remapping and accessibility considerations.
5. **Performance & Profiling:** Learn techniques for profiling CPU and GPU usage; understand memory management and allocation patterns to avoid GC pauses[libgdx.com](https://libgdx.com/#:~:text=libGDX%20is%20a%20cross,Android%2C%20your%20browser%20and%20iOS).
6. **Tools & Level Editors:** Research existing tools (Tiled, Ogmo, Spine) and how to integrate them; consider writing custom editors to streamline level design.
7. **Cross‚ÄëPlatform Input Devices:** Study handling controllers, touch screens, accelerometers and sensors; adapt input mapping for accessibility.
8. **Scripting & Modding:** Explore embedding scripting languages (Lua, Kotlin scripting) or designing domain‚Äëspecific languages (DSLs) so users can mod your game.
9. **Backend Integration:** Investigate connecting your game to a Scala backend via HTTP/REST, WebSockets or gRPC to store leaderboards, user accounts and multiplayer state.
10. **Publishing & Distribution:** Learn about packaging games for Steam, [itch.io](http://itch.io) and mobile stores; research build tools and distribution channels; understand licensing and monetisation models.
