## üì¶ Module¬†7 ‚Äì Java Interoperability¬†& the JVM Ecosystem (Weeks¬†13‚Äì14)

**Why this matters:** Scala runs on the JVM and interoperates almost seamlessly with existing Java code. Mastering interop lets you reuse huge Java libraries and gradually migrate Java projects to Scala.

### üìö Ten Research Topics

1. **Calling Java from Scala.** Learn how Scala treats Java classes and methods by default and why most Java code can be used directly without wrappers¬†[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/interacting-with-java.html#:~:text=This%20section%20looks%20at%20how,use%20Scala%20code%20in%20Java).
2. **Converting Java collections.** Investigate the `scala.jdk.CollectionConverters` API to convert `java.util` collections into Scala‚Äôs mutable or immutable collections¬†[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/interacting-with-java.html#:~:text=When%20you%E2%80%99re%20writing%20Scala%20code,as%20you%20would%20in%20Java).
3. **Handling `Optional` and `Option`.** Compare Java‚Äôs `Optional` class with Scala‚Äôs `Option`, and learn conversion patterns.
4. **Extending Java interfaces.** Study how traits map to interfaces and how to implement Java interfaces in Scala.
5. **Exposing Scala to Java.** Research how Scala‚Äôs classes and objects appear in Java, including companion objects and varargs methods.
6. **Concurrency interop.** Compare Java‚Äôs `CompletableFuture` with Scala‚Äôs `Future` and see how to convert between them.
7. **Using Java 8 Streams API.** Examine the functional Stream API and how to integrate it with Scala collections.
8. **Interacting with popular Java libraries.** Explore using frameworks like Spring, JUnit, Jackson, Guava, and Apache Commons from Scala.
9. **Null‚Äësafety vs `Option`.** Understand how Scala encourages use of `Option` instead of nulls and what this means when calling Java code.
10. **Interoperability pitfalls.** Research issues like raw types, type erasure, exceptions, and overloading differences between Java and Scala.

### üîç Libraries & Frameworks to Explore (Java/Scala/JVM)

- **Apache Commons Lang/IO:** Utility methods that you can call from Scala to enhance string and file handling.
- **Guava:** Google's core libraries; explore `Optional`, caching, and immutable collections.
- **Jackson Databind:** JSON serialisation/deserialisation library widely used in Java and Scala.
- **JUnit/JUnit¬†5:** Testing framework; see how to write Scala tests using it.
- **Spring Boot:** Framework for building microservices; experiment with embedding Scala classes.
- **Project Lombok:** For reducing boilerplate in Java; see how Scala‚Äôs case classes achieve similar goals without extra tools.

### üìñ Definitions

- **Java Interoperability:** The ability for Scala code to call Java classes/methods directly and vice versa; ensures reuse of existing JVM code.
- **Collection Converters:** APIs (e.g., `scala.jdk.CollectionConverters`) that convert `java.util` collections into Scala‚Äôs mutable/immutable collections and back.
- **Optional/Option:** `Optional` is Java‚Äôs container for possibly missing values introduced in Java¬†8; `Option` is Scala‚Äôs equivalent. Converting between them is essential when intermixing code.
- **Trait vs Interface:** Scala traits can have concrete methods and fields; when compiled, they map to interfaces with static helper methods on a companion class.
- **CompletableFuture vs Future:** Java‚Äôs `CompletableFuture` supports callback chaining and can be completed manually; Scala‚Äôs `Future` runs tasks asynchronously using an execution context and is more functional.

### üí° Concepts

- **Seamless Usage:** Because both languages compile to JVM bytecode, Scala can use most Java code ‚Äúas-is‚Äù[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/interacting-with-java.html#:~:text=This%20section%20looks%20at%20how,use%20Scala%20code%20in%20Java). Only special types (collections, `Optional`, varargs) need conversion.
- **Bridging Collections:** Java‚Äôs collections are mutable and untyped; Scala uses immutable and strongly typed collections. Converters transform them into idiomatic Scala data structures¬†[docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/interacting-with-java.html#:~:text=When%20you%E2%80%99re%20writing%20Scala%20code,as%20you%20would%20in%20Java).
- **Null Safety:** Scala minimises null usage, encouraging `Option` to represent missing values. When calling Java, you must handle potential `null`s.
- **Exception Handling:** Java has checked exceptions; Scala does not. You‚Äôll often wrap Java calls in `Try`/`Either` or handle exceptions explicitly.
- **Reflection & Bytecode:** Understanding how Scala compiles to classes helps when debugging interop issues, especially with generics and type erasure.

### üß™ Applications

- **Wrapping Java APIs:** By converting Java collections and `Optional` values, you can wrap a Java API into a Scala-friendly facade that uses case classes, pattern matching and `Option`.
- **Using Scala in Java Projects:** You can gradually introduce Scala modules into existing Java codebases, exposing classes with Java‚Äëcompatible signatures (no top‚Äëlevel functions). This allows teams to adopt Scala incrementally.
- **Cross‚Äëlanguage Concurrency:** Compose asynchronous pipelines by converting between `CompletableFuture` and Scala `Future`. This makes it possible to integrate Java frameworks like Spring WebFlux with Scala logic.
- **Testing & Tooling:** Use SBT to compile Scala sources alongside Maven or Gradle builds for Java; or use mixed build configurations so you can run both ScalaTest and JUnit.

### üìå Additional Tips & Resources

1. **üí° Use `AnyRef` for Java generics:** When type parameters cannot be inferred, specify `AnyRef` or a specific class to help the compiler.
2. **üîÅ Be mindful of varargs:** Scala methods using varargs become `Seq` in Java; conversely, Java varargs become arrays in Scala.
3. **üß∞ Try SBT‚Äôs `javacOptions`:** When compiling Java sources with SBT, set flags for linting and warnings to ensure interop correctness.
4. **‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid Raw Types:** Raw Java generics lose type information; always specify type arguments when calling from Scala.
5. **üõ†Ô∏è Use IDE support:** IntelliJ IDEA and Metals have excellent tools for navigating mixed Scala/Java projects.
6. **üìú Read Bytecode:** Use `javap` to inspect compiled Scala classes and see how Scala constructs map to Java constructs.
7. **üèóÔ∏è Explore `scala.reflect` API:** For advanced interop, reflection can generate Java proxies or interop code at runtime.
8. **üß™ Compare Test Frameworks:** Write the same tests using ScalaTest and JUnit; note differences in syntax and output.
9. **üì¶ Try Gradle‚Äôs Scala plugin:** Build mixed projects using Gradle and see how dependencies are resolved.
10. **üîÑ Evaluate conversion performance:** Some conversions (like large collection wraps) can be costly. Benchmark them using JMH.
